# LinkedIn Job Scraper
> Job searching can get time consuming looking for the right job that you believe you qualify for, right location, right pay, along with many other factors.  So I decided to create this program to automate this process as it will aggregate job positions that you are looking for on LinkedIn and put them in an excel file.

To get this project set up and running on your machine, follow the following steps.

First check if pip is installed using  ```pip --version```, if its not installed, go ahead and install pip.
